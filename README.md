# Introduction
This is an isolated git repository containing a local cache of
data files used by [Zhongmu][zhongmu] ("中目"). See also
[github.com/mbivert/zm][gh-mb-zm].

The files are uncompressed, voluminous, and frequently updated
by upstream, hence the ``.git/`` grows a bit too much for a code
repository, and the files are better kept separated.

Information about upstream & download scripts can all be found
on [github.com/mbivert/zm][gh-mb-zm]. Licenses and sources are
also listed in [``LICENSE.md``][gh-mb-zm-data-license] and on
[zhongmu.eu/about.html][zm-about]
