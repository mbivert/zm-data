# Character visual explanation.
#
# TODO: having started to use accents instead of numbers on the UI,
# some tones may be incorrect here.
#
# Same format as CC-CEDICT, besides us allowing empty lines.
#
# As we're interesting purely visual information, pinyins are
# at best provided as indications, and often omitted within
# descriptions.
#
# And for similar reason, as character's decomposition is
# often richer with traditional Chinese characters, we mostly
# ignore the correspondance with simplified characters.
#
# Personnal interpretations perhaps should be considered
# as mnemonic rather than grounded in proper Chinese
# character etymologycal research.
#
# As for dict2.csv, we mention direct sources.
